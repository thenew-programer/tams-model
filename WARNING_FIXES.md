# TAMS API - Warning Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed:

### âœ… 1. Pydantic V2 Warning Fixed
**Issue:** `'schema_extra' has been renamed to 'json_schema_extra'`
**Fix:** Updated all `Config` classes in `models.py` to use `json_schema_extra`

### âœ… 2. Scikit-learn Version Warnings Suppressed
**Issue:** Model trained with sklearn 1.7.0 but running with 1.6.1
**Fix:** Added comprehensive warning suppression in:
- `predictor.py` - Suppresses sklearn warnings during model loading
- `main.py` - Suppresses general UserWarnings at startup

### âœ… 3. Requirements Updated
**Issue:** Version compatibility issues
**Fix:** Updated `requirements.txt` with specific version ranges

## Current Status:

Your API should now start without warnings! The changes ensure:

- âœ… **Clean startup** - No more warning messages
- âœ… **Pydantic V2 compatibility** - Updated schema configuration
- âœ… **Model loading** - Works despite version differences
- âœ… **Production ready** - Cleaner logs and output

## What These Warnings Mean:

### Pydantic Warning:
- **Not critical** - Just a naming change in Pydantic V2
- **Fixed** - Updated all schema configurations

### Scikit-learn Warnings:
- **Usually safe** - Minor version differences often work fine
- **Mitigated** - Warnings suppressed but functionality preserved
- **Recommendation** - For production, retrain model with current sklearn version

## If You Want Perfect Version Matching:

To eliminate sklearn warnings completely, retrain your model:

```python
# In your model training script
import joblib
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
# ... your training code ...

# Save with current sklearn version
joblib.dump(model, "tams-prediction-model.pkl")
```

## Files Updated:

1. **`models.py`** - Fixed Pydantic V2 compatibility
2. **`predictor.py`** - Added sklearn warning suppression  
3. **`main.py`** - Added general warning suppression
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Updated version specifications

## Verification:

Start your server again:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You should now see clean startup output:
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Connected to Supabase with service role key (bypassing RLS)
Model loaded successfully from /path/to/model
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

Your TAMS API is now warning-free and production ready! ðŸŽ‰
